# CIFAR-10-Image-Classification
Created  a Convolutional Neural Network to classify the  various categories in the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects.
In this I have also Implemented the Concept of Transfer Learning using VGG-16.

Also there is horse vs human classifier..
